Rersearch business models

My project is to dominate the world wide life drawing landscape.
The priciliple trinity is the relationships between the host, life model and the artist.

- The host is looking for artists to attend their events, and needs to book a model for their event
- The model is looking for work with a host
- The artist is looking for events with models to create artwork, and practice their craft.

I want you to research how this objective is achieved by similar business models, i want you to look at UBER and TINDER.
List the systems they have in common, and how those will work with this new project.

## Research Findings

### Uber - Marketplace Model

**Core Systems:**

| Uber System                       | Life Drawing Equivalent                   |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Rider ↔ Driver matching**       | Host ↔ Model matching                     |
| **Geolocation**                   | Find models/hosts/events nearby           |
| **Availability status**           | Model availability calendar               |
| **Surge pricing**                 | Premium rates for last-minute bookings    |
| **Ratings (bidirectional)**       | Hosts rate models, models rate hosts      |
| **Scheduled rides**               | Book model for future session             |
| **Payment escrow**                | Platform holds payment until job complete |
| **Cancellation penalties**        | Track no-shows, late cancellations        |
| **Driver tiers (Uber Black, XL)** | Model tiers (experienced, professional)   |
| **Trip history**                  | Booking history for both parties          |

**Key Takeaways for Your Project:**

1. **Trust through ratings** - Both sides rate each other; low ratings reduce visibility
2. **Availability broadcasting** - Models can "go online" to signal availability
3. **Instant vs scheduled** - Support both last-minute and advance bookings
4. **Transparent pricing** - Show rates upfront, no negotiation friction
5. **Platform takes cut** - Uber takes 20-25%; you could take a flat fee instead

### Tinder - Discovery & Matching Model

**Core Systems:**

| Tinder System               | Life Drawing Equivalent                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Profile cards**           | Model portfolio cards, host event cards              |
| **Swipe (like/pass)**       | Follow / favorite models or hosts                    |
| **Mutual match**            | Host follows model + model follows host = connection |
| **Filters (age, distance)** | Filter by location, rate, experience, style          |
| **Super Like**              | Priority booking request / featured placement        |
| **Boost (paid)**            | Pay to appear at top of search results               |
| **Verification badge**      | Verified identity (important for safety)             |
| **Messaging (post-match)**  | Only message after mutual follow                     |
| **Premium tiers**           | Free vs paid features                                |

**Key Takeaways for Your Project:**

1. **Discovery is visual** - Good photos drive engagement
2. **Mutual interest unlocks comms** - Reduces spam, increases quality interactions
3. **Scarcity creates value** - Limited "super likes" make them meaningful
4. **Freemium model** - Basic access free, power features paid
5. **Filters reduce friction** - Let hosts find models by: distance, rate, experience, availability

## Hybrid Model: "Uber for Life Drawing"

Combining both approaches:

### Discovery Phase (Tinder-like)

- Hosts browse model profiles (cards with photo, rate, location, experience)
- Models browse host/event listings (cards with venue, schedule, pay rate)
- Both can "follow" each other
- Mutual follows unlock direct messaging

### Booking Phase (Uber-like)

- Host posts a session with date/time/rate
- System suggests available models in area
- Host sends booking request
- Model accepts/declines
- Confirmed booking triggers calendar entry
- After session: both parties rate each other

### Monetization Comparison

| Revenue Stream  | Uber       | Tinder            | Your Project          |
| --------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Transaction fee | ✓ (20-25%) | ✗                 | Optional              |
| Subscription    | ✗          | ✓ (Gold/Platinum) | ✓ (hosts/pro models)  |
| Boost/promote   | ✗          | ✓                 | ✓ (featured listings) |
| Verification    | ✗          | ✓                 | ✓ (verified badge)    |

## Risk Considerations

| **Payment disputes**  | Escrow, support team                   | Start with external payment (hosts pay direct) |
| **Safety (physical)** | GPS tracking, emergency button         | Verified venues, public spaces only            |

## Competitive Advantage

What makes this different from Uber/Tinder:

1. **Niche focus** - Specialized for life drawing community
2. **Three-sided market** - Host ↔ Model ↔ Artist (vs two-sided)
3. **Community-first** - Support hobbyist hosts, not just commercial
4. **Global ambition** - No existing dominant player in this space
5. **Low-cost entry** - Free tier for individuals, pay only for commercial use
