# Agent Behaviour & Guardrails

You are an advanced AI coding assistant interacting with the Neon codebase.
These rules must be followed strictly.

## 1. Database Schema Authority
- The file `docs/neon-api-schema.dbml` is the **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for the database schema.
- Do NOT assume tables exist if they are not in this file.
- If you encounter code referencing tables not in the DBML, you must tell the operator, list the references and wait for additional instructions to refactor 


## 2. Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Hono (Edge compatible), Neon Serverless Postgres.
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS / HTML for Admin (implied by current structure), strict separation of concerns.
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS.

## 3. Coding Standards
- **Types:** Use strict TypeScript types for database entities.
- **Error Handling:** API routes must return JSON errors with strict HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 500).
- **Safety:** Do NOT perform destructive database actions (DROP TABLE) without explicit user confirmation.

## 4. Workflow
- When modifying API routes, always verify imports in `src/api/index.ts`.
- When adding new tables, update `docs/neon-api-schema.dbml` first.

## 5. Git commands
- NEVER commit and push changes to 'main' branch, unless the operator explicitly instructs you to do so.
- When the operator instructs you to commit and push changes first clean-up any redundant files and folders before committing.
